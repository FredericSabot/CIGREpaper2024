This folders contains:

- Optimised_Parameters: the parameters of the dynamic equivalents fitted for different operating conditions (load (percent of peak load), DER instantaneous capacity factor, DER installed share, DER legacy share, in that order).
- dynawo_files: the Dynawo files used (it contains the complete description of the dynamic equivalents, but only the job files for the UKGDS networks. The remaining files for the UKGDS networks are generated by ukgds_to_dynawo.py)
- UKGDS: the orignal UKGDS data
- DynamicEquivalent.py, the main files used to build dynamic equivalents of distribution networks.

## Changes compared to ukgs data

Max tap of the GSP transformers increased from 1.05 to 1.1 for ehv1 and ehv2 (allows for acceptable voltage even if the GSP voltage is 0.95pu)
In ehv1, the map tap of the 304/321 transformer (just after the sub-sea cable) is increased from 1.05 to 1.1.
In ehv2, the max tap of the 132/66kV transformers are increased from 1.1 to 1.15 (non standard but seems necessary, a shunt capa could also be added). Same for the 275/132kV tfos in the ehv3 network.

All transformers taps are set to obtain acceptable voltage profiles at peak load.

Voltage Regulations
In accordance with The Electricity Safety, Quality and Continuity Regulations 2002 (which replace the
Electricity Supply Regulations 1988), the voltage supplied to customers must not, other than in exceptional
circumstances, vary from the declared value by more than the values indicated in Table 2 below.
Declared Voltage Variation in Voltage from that Declared

LV not exceeding 10 percent above or 6 percent below
HV not exceeding 6 percent above or below
33kV not exceeding 6 percent above or below
