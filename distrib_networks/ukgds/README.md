# UKGDS

The United Kingdom Generic Distribution System (UKGDS) is a collection of
power system network models that are representative of UK distribution
networks.

## Unofficial

The UKGDS was developed by the
[Centre for Sustainable Electricity and Distributed Generation][SEDG] (SEDG).
The [link](http://www.sedg.ac.uk/ukgds/) to the UKGDS resources is currently
(29/04/2015) broken. This repository will provide an unofficial home for the
network models until such a time as the resources are back online or a
[takedown request][takedown] from SEDG is received. May it prove useful in the
meantime.

## License

No license for the UKGDS resources has been issued by SEDG. This

## Phase 1 Models

### EHV1

The [EHV1 model](ehv1.xls) is a 33kV rural network fed from a 132kV supply
point. The network has long lines, including a sub-sea cable between buses
318 and 304, leading to voltage problems at the extremities of the network.

### EHV2

The [EHV2 model](ehv2.xls) is a large rural network with interconnection at
132kV and three separate 33kV sub-networks. Some of the 33kV networks are
looped but voltage problems still arise and are alleviated with shunt
capacitors.

### EHV 3

The [EHV3](ehv3.xls) model represents a suburban area with mixed construction.
The topology is mostly radial but with some interconnection within the network
and links to neighbouring 33kV networks.

### EHV4

The [EHV4](ehv4.xls) model represents a suburban, meshed network. There are
interconnections to neighbouring networks at 132kV.

### EHV5

The [EHV5](ehv5.xls) model is a meshed, urban network with mostly direct
132/11kV transformation but with a disturbing load connected through 33/6.6kV
transformers.

![EHV5](ehv5.png?raw=true)

### EHV6

The [EHV6](ehv6.xls) model represents an underground, urban network. The
topology is strongly radial with conventional 132/33kV and 33/11kV
transformation.

### HV OHa/b

The [HV OHa](HV_OHa.xls)/[b](HV_OHb.xls) model is an 11kV rural network fed
from a 33kV supply point.

### HV OH-UGa/b

The [HV OH-UGa](HV_OH-UGa.xls)/[b](HV_OH-UGb.xls) model is an 11kV rural -
urban network fed from a 33kV supply point.

### HV UG

The [HV UG](HV_UG.xls) model is an 11kV urban network fed from a 33kV supply
point.

### HV UG-OHa/b

The [HV UG-OHa](HV_UG-OHa.xls)/[b](HV_UG-OHb.xls) model is an 11kV urban -
rural network fed from a 33kV supply point.
